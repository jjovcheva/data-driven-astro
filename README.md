# Data Driven Astronomy
This repository contains my work for the University of Sydney's Data Driven Astronomy course. It is divided as follows:
- `stats`: Aimed at processing and analysing astronomical catalogues, useful for efficient astronomical data handling.
- `sql`: Contains tools for data processing, database management, and querying of exoplanet data.
- `ml`: Applies machine learning algorithms, notably decision trees and random forests, to the problem of galaxy classification.
