# Data Driven Astronomy
Some of my work for the University of Sydney's Data Driven Astronomy course. 
Currently in progress but will eventually contain most of the scripts and exercises from the course.
`fits_stats.py` is a useful tool for basic statistical analysis on FITS/CSV-format astrophysical catalogues.
