# Data Driven Astronomy
This repository contains my work for the University of Sydney's Data Driven Astronomy course. It is divided as follows:
- `stats`: Aimed at processing and analysing astronomical catalogues, useful for efficient astronomical data handling.
  - Contains `fits_stats.py`, a useful tool for basic statistical analysis on FITS/CSV-format astrophysical catalogues.
- `sql`: Contains tools for data processing, database management, and querying of exoplanet data.
  - Processes data predominantly using SQL (hence the name), but also explores the process of applying SQL-type queries in Python.
  - The data queried is included in the form of CSV files.
- `ml`: Applies machine learning algorithms, notably decision trees and random forests, to galaxy data.
  - Explores both regression for galaxy colours and classification for galaxy types.
  - The algorithms are applied to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
